👋 Hello! Welcome to my GitHub.

I’m a Data Analytics and Data Engineering practitioner with hands-on experience building end-to-end data solutions — from raw data ingestion and analysis to dashboards and intelligent, ML-powered systems. I enjoy turning messy, real-world data into clear insights and scalable solutions that support better decision-making.

🔍 What you’ll find here:
• Interactive Tableau dashboards (Netflix analytics, global population, world health, COVID-19) focused on exploratory analysis and data storytelling  
• An Air Traffic Control (ATC) analytics project working with structured data to uncover patterns and simulate operational insights  
• A Financial Chatbot leveraging NLP and ML to enable natural language question-answering over financial datasets  

🧠 Across my projects, I focus on:
✔ Clean data modeling and transformation  
✔ Insight-driven analytics and visualization  
✔ ML/NLP-powered systems for decision support  
✔ Practical, production-minded problem solving  

🛠 Tech Stack: Python | SQL | Tableau | Excel | Pandas | NumPy | NLP | ML | AWS | GCP  
🎯 Interests: Analytics Engineering • Data Systems • Visualization • Applied ML • Automation  

Always learning, building, and refining — and open to collaboration on meaningful, real-world data challenges.
