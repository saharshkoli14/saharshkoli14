Data Analytics & Engineering Enthusiast | Turning Raw Data into Insightful Stories

I’m a data analyst with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Tableau, and cloud platforms, focused on transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. My work spans data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and pipeline thinking—bridging technical execution with business understanding.

This profile features hands-on projects centered around interactive Tableau dashboards, including Netflix content analysis, global population trends, world health indicators, and COVID-19 data. Each project emphasizes data storytelling, exploratory analysis, and decision-focused visualization rather than static reporting.

I’m particularly interested in:

Analytics-driven decision making

Dashboard design & data storytelling

Data engineering fundamentals (ETL, data modeling)

Real-world datasets across health, media, and public data

Currently building skills at the intersection of analytics, systems, and strategy, with a mindset of continuous learning and practical impact.

📊 Tools: Python | SQL | Tableau | Excel | Pandas | Cloud (AWS/GCP)
📌 Focus: Analytics • Visualization • Data Systems • Insight Delivery

Always open to collaboration, feedback, and meaningful data conversations.
