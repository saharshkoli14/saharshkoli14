Data Analytics & Engineering | Applied ML & Data Systems

I’m a data analytics and data engineering practitioner with hands-on experience building end-to-end data solutions—from raw data ingestion and analysis to visualization and intelligent systems. My work focuses on solving real-world problems using Python, SQL, Tableau, and cloud-native tools, with an emphasis on clarity, scalability, and impact.

This GitHub showcases a range of applied projects, including:

Interactive Tableau dashboards (Netflix analytics, global population, world health, COVID-19) focused on exploratory analysis and data storytelling.

An ATC (Air Traffic Control) analytics project, working with structured data to extract patterns, improve decision support, and simulate operational insights.

A Financial Chatbot project leveraging NLP and ML techniques to enable question-answering over financial datasets, bridging analytics with intelligent user interaction.

Across projects, I emphasize:

Clean data modeling & transformation

Insight-driven analytics and visualization

ML/NLP-powered systems for decision support

Practical, production-minded problem solving
